Add as a browser source in OBS for the scene and preset timer you would like (marked in the filename). It will start immediately; to reset, click "refresh" within OBS.

If you wish to customise the time more than the given variations, please open the file in a text editor and follow the instructions there.
Please note it takes OBS about a second to load the file, so it is a good idea to add an extra second.

I made this as an alternative to the solution Streamelements uses, which is somehow harder to customise on the fly; the solution I have isn't close to perfect, but as it's self hosted it can't go down mid-stream, and it's easier to add to OBS.
