Add as a browser source in OBS for the scene and preset timer you would like (marked in the filename). It will start immediately; to reset, click "refresh" within OBS.

If you wish to customise the time more than the given variations, please use the supplied python program.
If you wish to customise the look, you can do that by changing the CSS in the HTML file generated, or by changing your copy of the program.
Please note it takes OBS about a second to load the file, so it is a good idea to add an extra second.

I made this as an alternative to the solution Streamelements uses, which is somehow harder to customise on the fly (in my opinion); the solution I have isn't close to perfect, but as it's self hosted it can't go down mid-stream, and it's easier to add to OBS.
